# JAVA_2D_game
This project is a basic 2D game built using Java, where I explored essential concepts like graphics, object movement, and collision detection. 
The goal was to create an interactive experience while learning the fundamentals of game programming.
Key Features:
✅ Built with Java’s built-in libraries
✅ Simple animations and object movements
✅ Basic collision handling
✅ Beginner-friendly and open to improvements
This project helped me strengthen my Java skills and get a hands-on feel for game development. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to share!
